# Bank Account App

Welcome to our fun and interactive Bank Account App! ðŸŽ‰

This app is designed to teach beginners about objects and classes in Python using a hands-on approach. With this app, you'll learn how to create a `BankAccount` class that can deposit, withdraw and check the balance of a bank account. You'll also learn how to create a simple Tkinter application to interact with the `BankAccount` class.

## Getting Started

To get started, all you need is a computer with Python and Tkinter installed. Clone this repository and run the `bank_app.py` file to start the app.

## How it Works

The `BankAccount` class has three methods: `deposit`, `withdraw` and `get_balance`. These methods allow you to deposit money into the account, withdraw money from the account and check the current balance of the account.

The Tkinter application has three buttons: "Deposit", "Withdraw" and "Check Balance". These buttons call the corresponding methods of the `BankAccount` class when clicked.

## Have Fun!

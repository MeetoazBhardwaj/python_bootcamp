    "In this Jupyter notebook, you will learn about classes and objects in Python using a bank account example. We will start by defining a BankAccount class and adding some basic attributes such as account number and balance. We will then add some methods to our class, including deposit, withdraw, and get_balance, to perform basic banking operations.By the end of this notebook, you should have a good understanding of how classes and objects work in Python and how to use them to create your own custom classes."
